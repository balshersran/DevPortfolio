      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I've always had a knack for coding. Just the idea of creating an
        app/website from my fingertips always intrigued me. I used to dabble in
        Android Studio Project way before I even knew what I was typing or
        creating. I'm more for functionality, but am very adaptable in frontend
        and backend. By functionality, I mean to say... I prefer making a button
        do something vs focusing on how a button looks, or what it says. The
        concept of making it work vs making it look pretty is what I do best.
        I'm Full Stack Software/Web Developer always on the look out for new
        projects and ideas to partake in. Feel free to contact me down below, or
        visit my LinkedIn to get to know me more!
